# Python-week1
Introductio To Python:
The computer stores its data in a memory and whwn it needs to retriev that data it follows a pointer ,which is an address that represents the location of the file you are looking for.
So when we write and run a computer program, we are actually communicating with the memory. The program generates bits of data called variables.

Python is a widely used programming language, that can be used for web development, machine learning, etc. You can download python from any browser, then you can run the setup.
To access python you can open cmd, then you type Python in the command line then press enter. You will see 3 greater than symbols, thats where you can write a line of code.
To write python programs,you need to download text editors like Jupyter Notebook, Visual studio code, pycharm etc.
You need to write the file name with the .py extention.
In programming we also use COMMENTS, which serves as a reminder to some programmers about what a line of code does.

VARIABLES AND TYPES
A variable is a basic unit of a program. Variables stores values. You can add a cell on jupyter notebook by clicking outside the cell on the left margin and press "a".
You can also run a line of code in cell by pressing Shift+ Enter buttons.
A variable that starts with a number cannot be used,onlu variables that containe upper case,lower case and underscore are accepteble.
Traditionally in python, a variable starts with a lower case.
Variables and data types in python include:
Integers-whole numbers
floats-decimal numbers
string-collection of characters
complex numbers-used for complex mathematical calculations
Booleans- True or false values.
When working with strings, the plus operator sign is used to concatenate the stringsbut cannon be used to add string and numbers.its going to give an error.

DATA STRUCTURES IN PYTHON
In Python, data structures allow for the storage of a list of values in a single variable.
There is a list data structure, which stores values of any data type including a LIST within a List.

The length of a list can be determined using the length fuction.
There is a Set data structure which is similar to a list data structure but it contains only the unique elements and is declared using the curly braces.
The order of elements in a Set is not important ,unlike in a List.
There is also a Tuple data structure,which are similar to Lists, but cannot be changed once declared. They are useful when you need to store large amounts of data more effeciently i memory.
Lastly,there is a Dictionary data structure- is a collection of key-value pairs, similar to a word and its definition in a book. Dictionaries are declared using curly braces and accessed using keys.

OPERATORS
Operators are instructions that perform operations on variables and values in Python. 
They are used to manipulate and perform actions on data.
Arithmethic operators are the most commonly as they are used for mathematical calculation.
+: Plus operator
-: Minus
*: Multiplication
**:Exponet
/: Devide returns a floating-point value, even if the result is a whole number
%: Modulus return the remainder after division
Strings can also be manipulated using operators. The addition operator can concatenate or combine two strings together, while the multiplication operator can repeat a string a certain number of times.
It's important to note that the addition operator for strings works only with two strings, while the multiplication operator can work with either a string or a number

Comparison operators, logical operators, identity operators, and membership operators are another set of operators in Python.
Comparison operators evaluate two variables or values and produce a Boolean result, either true or false. Examples include:
the double equal sign for equality(==)
less-than(<) less-than or equal to(<=)
greater than(>)
greater than or equal to(>=)

Logical operators, such as "and," "or," and "not," operate on Boolean values. 
The "and" operator returns true only if both operands are true
while the "or" operator returns true if at least one operand is true. 
The "not" operator negates the Boolean value it operates on.

Membership operators, "in" and "not in," are used to check whether a value is present in a sequence or not. For instance, using "in" can check if a number or a string exists in a given list or string.

# Python-week1
Introductio To Python:
The computer stores its data in a memory and whwn it needs to retriev that data it follows a pointer ,which is an address that represents the location of the file you are looking for.
So when we write and run a computer program, we are actually communicating with the memory. The program generates bits of data called variables.

Python is a widely used programming language, that can be used for web development, machine learning, etc. You can download python from any browser, then you can run the setup.
To access python you can open cmd, then you type Python in the command line then press enter. You will see 3 greater than symbols, thats where you can write a line of code.
To write python programs,you need to download text editors like Jupyter Notebook, Visual studio code, pycharm etc.
You need to write the file name with the .py extention.
In programming we also use COMMENTS, which serves as a reminder to some programmers about what a line of code does.

VARIABLES AND TYPES
A variable is a basic unit of a program. Variables stores values. You can add a cell on jupyter notebook by clicking outside the cell on the left margin and press "a".
You can also run a line of code in cell by pressing Shift+ Enter buttons.
A variable that starts with a number cannot be used,onlu variables that containe upper case,lower case and underscore are accepteble.
Traditionally in python, a variable starts with a lower case.
Variables and data types in python include:
Integers-whole numbers
floats-decimal numbers
string-collection of characters
complex numbers-used for complex mathematical calculations
Booleans- True or false values.
When working with strings, the plus operator sign is used to concatenate the stringsbut cannon be used to add string and numbers.its going to give an error
